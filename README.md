# Battleship_Server 🎯

This project is a multiplayer Battleship server written in C.
It uses sockets and epoll for handling multiple clients at once, allowing players to register ships, send bomb commands, and receive real-time updates about the game state.

# 🛠️ Features

- Multiplayer support with non-blocking I/O using epoll.

- Registration system for joining with a name and placing a ship on the board.

- Bombing system for attacking coordinates on the grid.

- Validation checks for invalid names, duplicate registrations, and invalid moves.(Edge cases)

- Broadcasting system to notify all players of important events.

- Management for when players disconnect or lose.


# 🧰 Requirements

- GCC

- Linux/Unix environment

# Starting up the Server

1. Ensure all files are in same directory
2. Compile using gcc
`gcc -o battleship main.c helpers.c`

4. Run program to start server by inputting a port number
`./battleship <port>' (e.g. port==8710)`

#Connecting to server

Open a terminal to connect to the server

#Game Instructions

Board: Played on a 10×10 grid with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).

Ships: Each player has a single ship, either horizontal (1×5) or vertical (5×1).

Joining: Players can connect anytime by registering with a name and ship placement.

Bombing: Any player can bomb any cell at any time.

If a bomb hits one or more ships, the server announces the hit or else announces a miss.

Damage: Each ship has 5 cells. Once all are damaged, that ship is sunk, and the player loses and is automatically disconnected.

Leaving: Disconnecting is treated the same as losing.

Broadcasts: The server announces all major events:

New players joining

Bombing results

Player elimination
